        <br>
        ... Email copy, Ad copy, SEO. Web Sites (also Shopify).


    </h3>
    <p>First, I like old website design because it's convenient, anything is easy to find, and there are not a lot of distractions.<br>That said, I can code a good-looking page. See <span><a
        href="../../index.html">my main page</a></span> for an example. </p>

    <p>My mission is to help you show your prospect that your product is worth buying.
        <li>For that, I need to create a good-looking site.
        <li> Make sure that the site is in the top 5 google search results
        <li> Create a nice Ad, Landing page, and Email Copy
    </p>

    <p>I will not go into detail about how to build a website or SEO, but I will outline the process that it takes to make a good copy:</p>

                <b>Indicators of Competency </b> <br>
                If a business shows they know what they are talking about and then shows they even understand it at a
                level more profound than the customer. Then you’re more likely to trust them.

                <b>Relatability and Likeability </b> <br>
                If they like you, can relate to you, or aspire to be like you, they will think, “He’s one of us,

                <br><br>
                Now you need to MAGNIFY that trust. You do that by “trading up.”

                The more a business is trusted by its market, the more customers it will get, and the more it will be

                After research, you’ll usually write at least 100 fascinations to use as ammunition during your project.
                <br><br>
Take note of the exciting fascinations you see “out there in the wild” and save them for future reference. 
<br><br>
The best copywriters in the world are all masters at the art of writing fascination.

<br><br><br><br>

The creative thinking process
<br><br>

When you hit a dead end, you must ensure enough clarity on the Avatar, Problems, Desires, Roadblocks, Solutions, and Product. 
If you don’t have enough ammunition for the subconscious to draw on, the creative process stops dead in its tracks. 
<br><br>
Too harsh of a filter too early on. 
<br><br>
Whenever your subconscious comes up with an idea, it gets smacked down by the filter part of your brain. Then your subconscious mind tends not to want to come up with more ideas. Permit yourself to let the ideas flow, good or bad.
<br><br>
For example, permit yourself to write 100 TERRIBLE fascinations without filtering them out.
<br><br>
In the end, you’ll discover that after you let your subconscious brain run free, you came up with some pretty good ideas.
<br><br><br><br>

The brain is over-taxed.
<br><br>
The mind can get worn down if you’ve been doing Deep Work sessions. 
<br><br>
The reset break in between Deep Work Sessions is crucial. It is work. 
If you’re redlining your brain, get up and walk. You’ll be amazed at how many breakthroughs you’ll have on a walk or in the shower. 
<br><br>
Creativity is a skill. Develop it, and you’ll never face a challenge you can’t overcome. 
<br><br><br><br>
How To Evaluate And Improve Your Writing
<br><br>
It’s not enough to brain-dump ideas onto a Google Doc.
<br><br>
You need to review your work and improve it until you are confident it will achieve the desired results.
<br><br>
Writing is an iterative process: 
<br><br>
Observe → Orient → Decide → Act → Observe → Orient → Decide → Act →, etc.
